## Nohype AI Philosophy

* switzerland-based ai engineering company named "Nohype AI"
* We value sovereignty, transparancy and measurable value
* that implies among others the following rules:
  - no vendor lock-in (neither for us nor for the client)
  - client owns all project code
  - we only operate based on measurable KPIs, that's the starting point and precondition of any project
  - our approach to AI is data-driven and scientifc, we want to see measurable value impact
  - we can do fixed-price projects based on clear KPIs and domain-specific objectives without needing to design UX or technical architecture upfront
  - we do inference as locally as possible: on-device, on-premise, in the country
  - we prefer open source ai models
  - we don't need to sell our own solutions. we also know and can integrate third-party systems (like Palantir, Databricks, Knime ...)
  - none of our websites use any cookies (neither 1st nor 3rd party) or any 3rd party code (embeddings, frameworks, ads ...). our websites are simple, private and fast (3 important values of us)
